# incremental-classification
An incremental classification system for diabetic retinopathy detection using Keras and Tensorflow. Incrementally improve classification performance on fundus images using the following transfer methods:
1. Normal weight transfer
2. L2 weight transfer 
3. Elastic weight consolidation 
4. Distillation transfer
